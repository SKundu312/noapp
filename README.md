You may view the app on the url: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).\
You can upload csv files(a sample `contactForm1.csv` file is provided in the directory), which then get stored in db and can also be found in public/uploads folder.\
The results can be viewed in the terminal.\

To test the jwt authentication middleware, you may use Postman/Thunder Client in your VSCode etc. to register and login the user. Every registered user will receive a `x-auth-token`.

Use this token with auth middleware to test other routes.
